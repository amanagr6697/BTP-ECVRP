% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
As electric vehicles (EVs) become more widespread in supply-chain transportation, minimizing their total travel time is essential for improving efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, user satisfaction, traffic management, and overall accessibility within transportation networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of minimizing the maximum travel time among all EVs.  We develop an optimization framework that considers factors such as route selection, charging station availability, and battery capacity.   A mathematical model is proposed to determine the optimal solution, and we introduce a heuristic approach for efficiently finding near-optimal solutions.   Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed heuristic method can deliver a satisfactory solution, with a performance deviation of less than x\% from optimal solution for small inputs. For larger inputs, we evaluate heuristic methods to easily determine the effective solution for improving travel time in electric vehicles.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely employed in public transit, commercial fleets, and last-mile delivery services, providing eco-friendly alternatives that reduce emissions and promote sustainable transportation solutions worldwide.
The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in transportation systems has prompted the need for electric vehicle routing. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs come with specific requirements such as charging stations, limited range, and varying energy consumption rates.  Therefore, when optimizing routes for EVs, key challenges include minimizing charging times, maximizing range coverage, and ensuring a balanced workload distribution among vehicles to enhance operational efficiency. As EV fleets continue to expand in various sectors, from delivery services to public transportation, the development of effective routing algorithms tailored to EVs becomes essential to maximize their benefits, minimize operational costs, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Thus, electric vehicle routing presents a compelling research problem crucial for advancing the integration and optimization of EVs in modern transportation systems.

Significant research efforts have been dedicated to developing effective routing and charging scheduling algorithms for electric vehicles (EVs) to meet various requirements. These include, reducing travel energy consumption, minimizing total elapsed time, and minimizing charging costs, minimizing queueing time, among others.
In~\cite{qian2020electric}, matrix decomposition and backtracking methods have been proposed to minimize the overall elapsed time, inclusive of charging time for EVs, by jointly optimizing both the routing of charging paths and the selection of charging stations.
In~\cite{alinia2019online}, a charging strategy for EVs was introduced for maximizing social welfare within station capacity constraints. A combination of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and heuristic methods was proposed to optimize delivery routes for cost efficiency and continuous vehicle charge in~\cite{pelletier2019electric}. Finding routing and energy management strategies together, aiming to optimize both travel time and energy consumption using MILP was discussed in~\cite{salazar2019optimal}. A variable neighborhood approach to address the location routing problem with constrained distance, aiming to minimize total costs was proposed in~\cite{almouhanna2020location}. 

An integrated model for energy consumption and range estimation, facilitating energy-efficient routing through prediction of energy usage on road segments and calculation of optimal routes using shortest path algorithms was presented in~\cite{de2019model}. An algorithm  was proposed in~\cite{bozorgi2017time} for EV efficient routing, minimizing energy consumption or travel time, using data mining techniques to derive routes from historical driving data. The author introduced potential routes from a conventional routing service, treating them as a reduced graph with integrated charging stations, and conducts a multi-objective shortest-path search to find the fastest route from start to destination in~\cite{morlock2019time}. In~\cite{schoenberg2022reducing}, a multi-criterion shortest-path search algorithm was developed using contraction hierarchies. To streamline computation, introduced a central charging station database to estimate waiting times, enabling an adaptive charging and routing strategy for reduced waits. In~\cite{ma2023time}, MILP model was proposed to minimize overall costs, including vehicle operation, energy, passenger travel time, and penalties, alongside an ALNS algorithm for near-optimal solutions in larger scenarios. 
%In~\cite{bac2021optimization}, variable neighbourhood search approach was proposed for electric vehicle routing problem, considering partial recharging for multiple depots, a diverse EV fleet, and multiple customer visits.

This study focuses on an electric vehicle routing problem wherein a fleet of EVs needs to depart from a depot, deliver items to customer locations, and then return to the depot, while also fulfilling  charging requirements along the route. Customer requests and locations are known in advance. Our aim is to efficiently assign EVs to meet customer demands in the shortest time possible while statically determining routing and scheduling. To accomplish this goal, we propose an hour-ahead routing scheduler designed to minimize the maximum travel time among all EVs. We define the problem as a constrained optimization model, given its NP-Hard complexity~\cite{erdelic2019survey}, and implement heuristic approaches to rapidly produce near-optimal solutions. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of these heuristics. Additionally, we provide a detailed list of notations used in this article in Table~\ref{Table1}. 

\cmt{The outline for this paper is as follows. 
Section~\ref{sec:model} presents the system model and problem definition. Constraint optimization programming (COP) model and heuristic approaches are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:COP} and Section~\ref{sec:heuristic}, respectively.
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, results are discussed. 
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:CF}, concludes the paper.}

\section{System Model and Problem Definition} \label{sec:model} 

\subsection{System Model}  \label{sec:model1} 
\vspace{-0.1cm}
We consider an EV transportation network comprising a set of customer locations,  charging stations, and a single depot. The set of all customers is denoted as $I = \{I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_n\}$, each customer is defined by attributes such as location and parcel weight. A set of charging stations is defined as $F = \{F_1 , F_2 , \ldots, F_j\}$, distributed across various locations, along with a set of battery swapping stations $B=\{B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m\}$. A fleet of EVs  $E=\{E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k\}$  is available for parcel delivery, with each EV having attributes such as maximum battery power, discharging rate (dependent on weight), threshold battery capacity, and maximum capacity (weight) of the EV.



\subsection{Problem Statement:}
Given the network $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ comprising depot, customer, charging station  and battery swapping locations, and $E$ represents the set of all possible paths between them, EVs select a subset of customers to serve based on their individual requirements.
 At each charging station, EVs will undergo full charging, selecting the charging medium based on the maximum daily charging cost. The goal is to find routes for each EV to fulfill the needs of their assigned customers and return to the depot while minimizing total time, which includes travel time, recharging time, and battery swapping time. Our objective is to minimize the maximum travel time among all EVs. Minimizing the maximum travel time among vehicles ensures efficient workload balancing, timely task completion, and improved service quality.

\begin{eqnarray}\label{Constraint 1}
   \textit{Minimize } \max_{k \in K} \{T_k\} 
\end{eqnarray}


$T_k=\Bigg\{ \sum_{i \in I_{0}} \sum_{ j \in I_{n+1}} x[i, j, k] \cdot t[i, j, k] \\
 + \sum_{i \in I_{0}} \sum_{j \in F_{comb} } x[i, j, k] \cdot T[i,j, k] \Bigg\} , \forall k \in K$

    where $x_[i,j,k] = 1$ indicates the $k^{th}$ vehicle is going from location $i^{th}$ to location $j^{th}$,
    $t_[i,j,k]$ is the time taken for the $k^{th}$ vehicle to travel from location $i^{th}$ to location $j^{th}$,
    $T_{ijk}$ is the time taken for charging or battery swapping if the vehicle travels from location $i^{th}$ to location $j^{th}$. To optimize the maximum total travel time of EVs (as described in Eq.~\ref{Constraint 1}), we need to calculate the travel time, charging time, and battery swapping time for each EV, while ensuring compliance with vehicle charging and capacity limitations, customer constraints (such as being serviced by only one EV), and routing restrictions.
 In the following section, we formalize the optimization problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) to obtain an optimal solution. Subsequently, we introduce heuristic approaches to quickly finding a near-optimal solution.


\section{Constraint Optimization Formulation } \label{sec:COP}
To optimize the performance of our proposed problem, we use constraint optimization programming as a modeling technique. We define decision variables and constraints to model the COP. 
 
%DCV: decision variable representing
We consider the following as decision variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x[i, j, k]$: a binary variable which is $1$, if $k^{th}$ vehicle follows path from  $i^{th}$ node to  $j^{th}$ node, otherwise $0$.
\item  $fastCh[i, k]$: binary variable for $k^{th}$ vehicle is $1$, if taking fast charging from $i^{th}$ station, otherwise $0$.
\item  $medCh[i, k]$:  binary variable for $k^{th}$ vehicle  is $1$, if taking medium charging from  $i^{th}$ station, otherwise $0$. 
\item $slowCh[i, k]$:  binary variable for $k^{th}$ vehicle is $1$, if taking slow charging from $i^{th}$ station , otherwise $0$.
\item  $battSwap[i, k]$: binary variable for $k^{th}$ vehicle  is $1$, swapping battery at $i^{th}$  station , otherwise $0$.
    \item  $u[i, k]$:  represents the weight of the $k^{th}$ vehicle if it visits the $i^{th}$ customer, which can take any integer value within the range $[0, demandWeight[k]]$.
    \item $y[i, k]$:  represents the total charge level of the $k^{th}$ vehicle upon arriving at the $i^{th}$ location ranges from 0 to $mxBatteryLevels[k]$.

\section{Heuristic Approaches} \label{sec:sa}
For the best resemblance to the real world there are some assumptions made like the velocity profiles of each vehicle for different sets of roads would be determined in advanced by assigning a weight factor to each vehicle(taken from Google Maps API with general traffic demand for that road profile). We would start off with the greedy allocation of weights to the vehicles, similar to bin packing problem but with each vehicle having different weights. The process goes as sorting all the customer demand weights in descending order and filling them one by one to the vehicle with the largest remaining capacity. After we have all the customer locations that would be served by a vehicle according to it's maximum weight, we use a version of Christofides algorithm to actually carve out the path that would be followed by each vehicle. Here, we have use Christofides algorithm to first construct the tour for each vehicle and then use 2-opt to refine the path of the vehicle. In worst cases, the algorithm guarantees that the solution will be within a factor of 3/2 of the optimal solution length, but in practice it is much more effective. After the tours are charted out for each vehicle. Now, since we would be having weight based discharging policy, and weight based speed policy for each vehicle, with all the information present on which customer to deliver what weight, the discharging rate could be calculated for the path between each node and the closest battery charging station/battery swapping station, there could be a need of multiple charges to actually reach the next customer location, that is also incorporated with each vehicle not falling below 10\% of it's maximum charge holding capacity. After this step we would be having the charge matrix for each charging station, i.e how many times charge is being demanded from a particular charging station and similarly how many times battery swaps are demanded from each battery swapping station. Each charging station would be having a predefined set of fast chargers, medium chargers and slow chargers, the variation among them comes in the form of cost it charges for charging a vehicle and the time it takes to charge. Now in the worst case scenario there could be an immediate surge on a particular charging station, where all the vehicles which require charging from a particular charging station turn out simultaneously. So, for allotting correct charger(fast, medium or slow) to each vehicle would depend upon it's total travel length and approximate total travel time calculated from assigning the fastest(taking minimum time ignoring amount it takes to charge to full capacity) charger to all the demanding vehicles and then as per the extra fast chargers used at each station, transferring some of them to medium and slow ones, the first ones to be swapped would be based upon the vehicle having the highest total running time and if that is also same for any 2 vehicles, the one using maximum amount to charge would be used. For battery swapping stations, we would not be doing any swapping unless cost restraints are exceeded due to an assumption that battery charging time always outweighs the battery swapping time by many folds and the cost percentage is not more than 1.5x of the charging cost. So, now with this optimization, we would be having all charging stations using the optimal number of fast, medium and slow chargers. Now, since we have the objective of minimizing the maximum time each vehicle takes, we would already be having our final answer(since the vehicle taking maximum time would anyways be using fast chargers from most optimal charging stations near to it's requirement, and would be a part of most efficient battery swaps) so now for more optimal solution, we would be normalizing the cost each vehicle takes, that is if any vehicle takes fast chargers/battery swaps and it's time is less than the objective time, we would try to decrease the total cost it takes by decreasing the number of fast chargers it uses and deliberately slowing it down by using medium/slow chargers unless it's total time doesn't exceeds the objective time achieved.
For the second version, this algorithm is run with random initialisation of weights for each vehicle carrying weights and re-run, the overall results after 50 iterations were 20\% more refined.
For the vehicles exceeding 10 hours of working time, a single node would be added on it's path with 0 delivery demand and 15 minutes of resting time for the vehicle as well as for driver swapping, since the discharging rate incorporates the battery's temperature, a certain amount of cooling time would decrease the discharging rate of the vehicle too. 
The time complexity of the above algorithm would be around $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + \log k \cdot n + k \cdot n+ k \cdot (F+B) \cdot n)$, and since $\mathcal{O}(\log k \cdot n) < \mathcal{O}(k \cdot n)$, so the complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + k \cdot n+ k \cdot (F+B) \cdot n)$.

\section{Simulation Results}
We implemented both results, the MINLP and the heuristics with greedy allocation and with random allocation of weights.
\textit{Input Parameters:} We consider multiple charging stations/battery swapping stations/customer locations, demand weights for each customer (12-30 kg), maximum load capacity for each vehicle (60-110 kg), maximum battery limit for different types of vehicles (1.5 kWh - 4 kWh), maximum allotted cost for vehicles (1000-9000 INR), speed of vehicles (30-50 km/h), standard working temperature of \(40^\circ\)--\(42^\circ\) Celsius, multiplicative factors for roads for speed (0.01-0.12), number of fast/medium/slow chargers (2-5), battery swapping cost (40-80 INR), fast charging rate (9-10 kW/h), medium charging rate (5-7 kW/h), slow charging rate (2-3 kW/h), and charging rates: fast (0.4-0.6 INR/W), medium (0.22-0.32 INR/W), slow (0.1-0.18 INR/W), battery swapping time (0.15-0.35 hours), and charging time per unit of charge: fast (0.004-0.005 hours/W), medium (0.006-0.008 hours/W), slow (0.11-0.14 hours/W). MINLP's simulation would not be feasible after 10 customer locations and 5-6 charging/battery swapping stations due to the cubic nature of the equations, so heuristic results are compared with respect to the greedy allocation and random allocation for smaller test cases between 10-50 customer nodes in test cases I-III and in IV, 10000 nodes were used for calculation.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:CF}
In this work, we presented a framework that minimizes the
time in terms of maximum total time that a vehicle remains on a road with most optimum least cost. We have formulated the optimization problem as
MINLP, which finds an optimal solution. We proposed heuristic approaches for finding near-optimal solutions quickly. With the heuristic approach the problem can be solved for over 10000 nodes with hundreds of charging stations within seconds. The discussed problem can be
extended to optimize the performance with more reals world use cases like partial charging, dynamic delivery/pickup insertion, waiting time, and penalty costs.
